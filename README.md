# Python Data Encryption Accelerator (DEA)

A Python implementation of the Data Encryption Accelerator algorithm.

## Overview

This is a Python version of the Data Encryption Accelerator (DEA) that performs encryption using a cycling key pattern. The implementation features:

- Multi-key support (up to 4 different keys)
- Key cycling during encryption
- XOR-based encryption algorithm
- Performance benchmarking

## Files

- `dea.py` - The core DEA implementation
- `benchmark.py` - Performance testing and demonstration script

## Usage

Run the benchmark:

```bash
python benchmark.py
```
